I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) and [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), advised by Professor [Hongyi Wen](https://whongyi.github.io/) in the [MAPS Research Group](https://whongyi.github.io/MAPS-research). I also work closely with Professor [Shengjie Wang](https://sheng-jie-wang.github.io/). Prior to that, I did my undergrad at NYU Shanghai, where I started my research journey with Professor [Li Guo](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo). I obtained my B.S. degree in 2023 and graduated with the Dean’s Award in Computer Science, Data Science, and Engineering.

I'm broadly interested in **generative modeling** and **representation learning**. My goal is to understand state-of-the-art paradigms (e.g., diffusion, AR) from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, and to develop efficient, intuitive, and explainable alternatives.

Outside of research, my hobbies span a wide range of areas, including philosophy, music, language, and divination. I devote one hour each week to open conversations with junior students. Please feel free to email me if you'd like to discuss research or life. <u>In today's meritocracy-driven society (where most people are rushing forward), it is also important to appreciate the experiences and scenery along the way.</u>

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
